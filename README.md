# 🚁 Multi-Drone Search & Rescue System

### Graph-Based Path Planning and Priority-Based Task Allocation for Dynamic Disaster Response

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Multi-Drone Search & Rescue System** is a simulation-based project designed to improve the speed and efficiency of rescue operations during dynamic disaster situations.

During disasters, multiple rescue requests can occur at different locations while drones have limited battery, availability, and capabilities. Manually managing these missions and selecting suitable routes can be time-consuming.

This project focuses on coordinating multiple UAVs using **Data Structures in C** and **Object-Oriented Programming in C++**.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

In a disaster situation:

- Multiple rescue missions may arrive simultaneously.
- Missions can have different priorities.
- Drones have limited battery and availability.
- Some routes may be blocked or unavailable.
- A drone failure may require task reassignment.
- Selecting the most suitable drone and route manually can be inefficient.

The proposed system provides a structured approach for **mission prioritization, drone assignment, route planning, and dynamic reallocation**.

---

## 💡 Proposed Solution

The system divides the problem into two major parts:

### 1. Mission Allocation

Rescue missions are assigned priorities and managed using a **Priority Queue**, ensuring urgent missions are handled first.

### 2. Route Planning

The disaster area is represented as a **Graph using Adjacency Lists**. Graph algorithms such as **Dijkstra and BFS** are used to find suitable routes between locations.

The system also considers drone availability, battery level, distance, and mission requirements while assigning drones.

## 🧠 Data Structures & Algorithms

| Concept | Application |
|--------|-------------|
| Graphs | Represent disaster-affected areas |
| Adjacency Lists | Store connections between locations |
| Priority Queue | Manage rescue missions based on priority |
| Queue | Manage pending tasks |
| Searching | Find suitable drones and locations |
| Sorting | Rank drones and missions |
| Dijkstra Algorithm | Find shortest/suitable paths |
| BFS | Explore reachable/search zones |
| Arrays | Store and manage system data |

## 💻 OOP Concepts Used

The system is designed using C++ Object-Oriented Programming concepts:

- Classes and Objects
- Encapsulation
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism
- STL Containers
- File Handling

### Major Modules

- **UAV** – stores drone information such as battery, location and availability.
- **Mission** – represents rescue requests and their priorities.
- **SearchZone** – represents disaster-affected areas.
- **Route** – manages paths between locations.
- **Coordinator** – handles drone-to-mission assignment.
- **Simulation** – demonstrates the working of the complete system.

## 🔄 Dynamic Features

The system is designed to respond to changing conditions during a rescue operation.

Examples include:

- Low drone battery
- Drone failure
- Blocked route
- New high-priority mission
- Mission reassignment
- Change in drone location

When required, the system can re-evaluate the situation and assign another suitable drone or route.
